  <h1> STUDENT ELECTRONIC ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT</h1>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>All students enrolled at SHS will be granted access to the internet and other programs through our district’s
      networked computer system. Sheridan School District #2 students using the computer network are expected to act in
      a responsible, ethical, and legal manner in accordance with National Educational Technology Standards (NETS),
      district policy, and applicable federal and state law. While using the computer network, students will have web
      access filtered in accordance with the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) and student browsing history may
      be monitored. Each student is responsible for their account access and use, and will be held accountable for any
      violations. While working on school devices or within school assigned accounts, such as Google Suite, students
      should have no expectation of privacy. Students who use personal devices while at school will be held accountable
      to the same acceptable use agreement as if using the school-owned devices. Students that violate the Acceptable
      Use Agreement will be subject to disciplinary consequences, removal of technology privileges, or both.</p>
    <p>Students will demonstrate positive social and ethical behaviors when using technology to work cooperatively and
      collaboratively with peers and others. Students will accept personal responsibility for maintaining a safe
      technology environment and understand consequences of inappropriate behavior.</p>
