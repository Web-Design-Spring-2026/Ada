        <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
 
        <p><p style="text-align: center;"> My hobbies are sleeping in my bed during the day because I don't sleep at night so I sleep during the day to
            catch up on sleep. I also have Guinea Pigs that are so sweet to people and naturally squeak at lot.I read a
            lot. While I can't sleep at night, I'll read during the night to settle me down as much as it can. 3 fun
            facts about me are I used to hate reading but turns out you have to find the correct books to read. I was a
            wrestler. I also used to love math but hate it now.I'm actually a big fan of Lil Peep!
