    <h2>Halloween</h2>
    <p>
      Halloween, is a celebration observed in many countries on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. It is at the beginning of the observance of All hallow tide time in the Christian liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the faithful departed,In popular culture, Halloween has become a celebration of horror and is associated with the macabre and the supernatural.

    <h3>Activies on halloween</h3>
    <p>Popular activities during Halloween include trick-or-treating (or the related guising and souling), attending Halloween costume parties, carving pumpkins or turnips into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, apple bobbing, divination games, playing pranks, visiting haunted attractions, telling frightening stories, and watching horror or Halloween-themed films. Some Christians practice the observances of All Hallows' Eve, including attending church services and lighting candles on the graves of the dead, although it is a secular celebration for others. Historically, some Christians abstained from meat on All Hallows' Eve, a tradition reflected in the eating of certain vegetarian foods on this day, including apples, potato pancakes, and soul cakes.

    <h3>Etymology</h3>
    <p>
      Hallow derives from Middle English halowen, from Old English hālig meaning holy and has been used synonymously with the word saint. The word Halloween or Hallowe'en comes from the Lowland Scots form of All Hallows' Eve (the evening before All Hallows' Day): even is the Scots term for 'eve' or 'evening',and is contracted to e'en or een; so (All) Hallow(s) E(v)en became Halloween. A term equivalent to 'All Hallows Eve' as attested in Old English. Thus, the name has an origin in Christianity,and means 'Saints' eve(ning)'.

    <h3>
Celtic folk influence
    </h3>
    <p>Modern Halloween customs are primarily rooted in the ancient Gaelic festival of Samhain, a liminal period marking the transition to the "darker half" of the year when the boundary between the physical world and the Otherworld was believed to thin. To navigate this time of heightened supernatural activity, Celtic-speaking communities engaged in rituals to appease spirits known as the Aos Sí and welcome the souls of returning ancestors through offerings of food and hospitality. These historical practices evolved into many of today’s familiar traditions: protective bonfires and divination games paved the way for modern festivities, while "guising"—the act of wearing costumes to impersonate or hide from spirits while going house-to-house for food—served as the precursor to trick-or-treating. Even the iconic jack-o'-lantern began as a protective measure, originally carved from turnips to represent or ward off wandering spirits before the practice eventually spread and adapted into the pumpkin-carving tradition we recognize today.</p>
    <h3>
    Haunted attractions
    </h3>
    <p>
      From humble origins as steam-powered "Ghost Houses" in 1915 England, haunted attractions have evolved into a massive global industry. While the 1930s and '50s saw the rise of American home haunts and charity-run venues, it was the 1969 debut of Disney’s Haunted Mansion that cemented the haunted house as a cultural icon. A pivotal—and tragic—turning point occurred in 1984, when a fatal fire at Six Flags Great Adventure led to strictly enforced safety codes. These new regulations effectively pushed out many smaller non-profits, paving the way for the high-tech, high-budget dominance of major theme parks like Universal Studios and Six Flags. Today, these commercial giants have globalized the "scare," turning seasonal thrills into a sophisticated, international entertainment phenomenon.

      Symbols
    </h3>
    <p>
      The visual identity of Halloween is a complex tapestry woven from folk legends, religious tradition, and 20th-century horror. Its most famous artifact, the jack-o'-lantern, stems from the Irish legend of "Stingy Jack," a man condemned to roam with a coal-lit turnip after tricking the Devil; this practice later adapted to pumpkins in North America because they were larger and easier to carve. Beyond folklore, the holiday’s aesthetic draws heavily from Christian motifs like skulls (serving as memento mori, or reminders of mortality) and depictions of the Last Judgment, as well as Gothic literature and cinema such as Frankenstein and Dracula. These deep historical roots now blend seamlessly with seasonal harvest symbols—like scarecrows and corn husks—and a signature color palette of black, orange, and purple to define our modern celebration.
