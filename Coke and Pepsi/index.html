    <p>Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi can trace their origins back to the 1890s, and the two sodas seemed to be able to
      peacefully co-exist until nearly a century later. But in the 1980s, the companies began directly taking aim at
      each other through their respective marketing campaigns during what is now known as the “Cola Wars.” Here’s a look
      at how that rivalry started — and where the two companies are now.</p>

  <h3>A Brief History of Coke and Pepsi</h3>

  <div class="history">
    <p>Coca-Cola was invented in 1986 by a pharmacist in Columbus, Georgia, who began selling it to soda fountains, the
      History Channel reported. Six years later, the Coca-Cola Company was founded. Pepsi was also invented by a
      pharmacist,
      who invented his own sugar drink in 1893. Five years later, he changed his soda’s name from “Brad’s Drink” to
      “Pepsi-Cola” and founded the Pepsi-Cola Company in 1902.</p>

    <p>For many years, Coke was the more popular drink while the Pepsi-Cola Company struggled financially and went
      through
      several reorganizations. Then, in 1975, Pepsi took its first direct hit at its rival.</p>

  <h3>The Wall Street Journal Declares Diet Coke the Winner of the ‘Cola Wars’</h3>

    <p>Although Coca-Cola sales had topped Pepsi’s sales for years, the two sodas were always No. 1 and 2, respectively.
      Then in 2010, Diet Coke sales topped Pepsi’s sales for the first time, leading The Wall Street Journal to run the
      headline, “Diet Coke Wins Battle in Cola Wars.”</p>

    <p>“Occupying the top two rankings would mark a historic win for Coca-Cola Co. in its decades-old rivalry with
      PepsiCo
      Inc., which has seen its market share slip in recent years and is trying to retool its marketing,” the article
      stated.</p>
