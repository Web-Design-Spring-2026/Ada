    <p>In order to stay competitive and keep its share of the soda market, Coca-Cola began introducing new products.
      Diet
      Coke was launched in 1982, and caffeine-free versions of both Coke and Diet Coke were introduced in 1983.</p>

    <p>Then in 1985, Coca-Cola made one of its most controversial moves when it launched “New Coke,” boasting a new,
      sweeter recipe more similar to Pepsi’s. This pivot backfired — consumers were outraged about the change and
      demanded
      the return of the original product.</p>

    <p>Although the “New Coke” debacle could have been a disaster for Coca-Cola, it actually ended up paying off for the
      brand. People were excited about the return of Coca-Cola Classic, and began buying more Coke as a result.</p>

    <p>“People all of a sudden wanted to actually taste the beverage again,” Greising told the History Channel.</p>

    <p>Coke has been able to ride this wave in the decades since, with Coca-Cola continuing to top Pepsi’s yearly sales
      going forward.</p>
