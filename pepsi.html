  <h2> The Pepsi Challenge</h2>
  <p>The “Pepsi Challenge” was the unofficial start of the soda rivalry. In 1975, Pepsi launched a marketing campaign
    that showed that during a blind taste test, more people preferred Pepsi over Coke.</p>

  <p>“The Pepsi Challenge was not just a marketing gimmick — it was true,” David Greising, author of “I’d Like the World
    To Buy a Coke,” told the History Channel. According to Greising, internal studies at Coca-Cola “confirmed what the
    Pepsi Challenge was showing, which is that if you just look at the taste of the beverage, consumers preferred
    Pepsi.”</p>

  <p>Although Coca-Cola was still the more popular beverage, its marketing share was now declining as Pepsi’s began to
    rise.</p>
  <h3>Pepsi Goes on the Attack </h3>
  <p>Pepsi capitalized on the “New Coke” backlash by releasing a commercial showing a young girl criticizing the brand,
    then trying a Pepsi and loving it. The commercial declared that Pepsi was “the choice of a new generation.”</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Coke was backtracking on its decision to switch its formula. Just three months after launching “New
    Coke,” Coca-Cola announced that it was relaunching its original soda as “Coca-Cola Classic.”</p>
